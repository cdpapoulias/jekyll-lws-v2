I"š<p>Do you use Googleâ€™s browser, called Chrome? I bet you do and guess what? Over half of the people browsing the Internet does.</p>

<p>Starting in July of 2018, youâ€™ll start seeing that any website that is not â€œhttpsâ€ secure by default will be labeled as insecure. See the image below from <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2018/02/a-secure-web-is-here-to-stay.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Googlesâ€™ blog post</a>:</p>

<p>Many websites have already enabled https, and all websites with logins like WordPress, Drupal, Craft CMS and many others need to be secured as well.</p>

<p>If you happen to visit a website that isnâ€™t secure, please do the Internet at large a favor and let the site owner know (usually through a Contact form, Support ticket or something like that). If youâ€™re unable to find a method, please <a href="https://leadingwebstudio.kinsta.com/contact/">fill out my contact form</a> and Iâ€™ll take care of it for you.</p>

<p>A safe, secure web is important to everyone and we all must do our part (see my <a href="https://leadingwebstudio.kinsta.com/blog/security/2017/03/website-security-everyones-problem/">other blog post from 2017</a> regarding this).</p>
