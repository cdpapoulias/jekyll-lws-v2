I"®<p>How often do you redesign your website? Has it been a year? 2 years? 5 years? Do you have no idea?</p>

<p>While there are many reasons why you havenâ€™t redesigned your website recently, it doesnâ€™t necessarily matter how long itâ€™s been (though that increases if you havenâ€™t redesigned in over two years), here are a few solid reasons why you need to redesign your site today (and <a href="/contact">hire LWS</a> to do it!):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Youâ€™re not getting traffic â€“ or, you donâ€™t even have a website analytics tool installed so you know how much traffic youâ€™re getting</li>
  <li>Your website is not secure with SSL, or, youâ€™ve been hacked</li>
  <li>Your website doesnâ€™t look good on a tablet or a smartphone</li>
  <li>Your content doesnâ€™t reflect your current offerings as a company</li>
  <li>Your website isnâ€™t helping your company or non-profit make money</li>
</ul>

<p>There are countless reasons to know whenâ€¦but the most important thing to do is <a href="https://leadingwebstudio.com/contact/">get in touch with your website company or person</a> and <a href="/services/website-audits-and-strategy">review your website</a>. Your business depends on it.</p>
