I"G<p>Picture it…Baltimore, Maryland, Loyola University Campus.</p>

<p>1999.</p>

<p>I bought a domain name for a senior project during one of my Information Sciences classes. I knew I wanted to make  the project come to life with an asp.net database web application. I also knew that I had always been interested in working for myself and working with great people running great businesses. Even if I just was consulting on the side, freelancing or consulting part-time while I had a full time job – I knew I wanted to start a business helping people with their websites.</p>

<p>Update (early 2016) : Here I am, almost two decades later, using a new domain name, a new company name and still helping people get the most from their websites.ed in. Feel free to <a href="/contact/">contact me</a> if you’re not sure how to use it.</p>
