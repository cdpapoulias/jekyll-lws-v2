I"m<p>CDinos.com has been re-born as Leading Web Studio, LLC!</p>

<p>I’m writing to you with some exciting news about CDinos.com Consulting – a new name! CDinos.com Consulting is now Leading Web Studio, LLC.</p>

<p>Why change the name, might you ask? It’s an easy question to answer – but first a little history. CDinos.com Consulting was originally born back in 2000 for a project at Loyola University Maryland. I’ve always loved small businesses and websites – so I decided to start consulting and helping people with websites. To this day, I have continued to provide awesome websites for awesome people. Between 2015 and 2016, I have seen CDinos.com Consulting experience unprecedented growth and exposure, which lead me to acknowledge that my company name doesn’t do justice to what I do – and so I embarked on a journey to find a new name. Hence, Leading Web Studio, LLC.</p>

<p>I will continue to provide the same basic set of services, with some expanded offerings this fall and in 2017.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading, and please, if you have any questions or concerns, email studio@leadingwebstudio.com.</p>
