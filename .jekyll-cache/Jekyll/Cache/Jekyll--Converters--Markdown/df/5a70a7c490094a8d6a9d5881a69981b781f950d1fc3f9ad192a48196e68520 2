I"ß	<p>I had intended on posting this during the last week in 2017, but with a new baby in the house along with a toddler, and the need to disconnect for a bit, itâ€™s just coming now. Yes, this post is backdated ðŸ˜‰</p>

<h3>2017</h3>
<p>2017 brought the first full year of my new company name and I welcomed many new awesome clients. I completed over 500 separate tasks, built 5 new websites, and am currently hosting/maintaining 30 websites, almost all using <a href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordPress</a> but a few with a <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruby</a>-basedÂ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CMS</a> called <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jekyll</a>. I also spent considerable time dealing with a few rogue clients, which prompted me to improve my filtering of new project requests. Iâ€™m now much stricter than I used to be, and this aligns well with one of my company goals â€“ to have great, ongoing relationships with my clients.</p>

<p>One thing I struggled with is the fact that I get so many emails on any given day. Some are simple questions, some require a one sentenceÂ reply, but the vast majority of them are tasks, work requestsÂ and assignments. Keeping everything straight was/is difficult. Iâ€™ve tried for many years using a combination of email and a project management system (like Basecamp, Teamwork, Proofhub, Asana â€“ you name it, Iâ€™ve tried it) but nothing was optimal.</p>

<h3>2018</h3>
<p>In 2018 I am implementing a new customer support system where all of the tasks, work requests and assignments will reside. One system to rule them all, if youâ€™re familiar with the fellowship of the ring ðŸ™‚ All my requests will reside in this system, and every client will get a login to see their requests â€“ and be able to set priority, needed completion dates etc. All my clients will have more information at their fingertips, be in more control, and Iâ€™ll be able to work more efficiently.</p>

<p>In 2018, Iâ€™ll be releasing at least one new subscription-basedÂ service to align the fact that the most successful websitesÂ are those continuallyÂ improved month after month.</p>

<p>I plan to blog A LOT more about a number of different topics, move more websites to static-flat file websites, engage with the website security community and network more.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading and see youÂ around the Interweb!</p>
