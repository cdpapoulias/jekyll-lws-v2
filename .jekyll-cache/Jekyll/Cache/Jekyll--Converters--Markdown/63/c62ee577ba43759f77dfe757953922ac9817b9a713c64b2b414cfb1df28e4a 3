I"Ÿ<p>Website security affects your business &amp; you, even when you think it doesnâ€™t.</p>

<p>They say that ignorance is bliss, and in some ways it is for other things in your life, but not your website. You should not be ignorant about your website and itâ€™s security.</p>

<p>Do you use WordPress, Drupal or other content management software? All of these systems must have their software updated at least on a weekly basis and sometimes the same day when a security update is released to ensure your site is protected. Itâ€™s kinda like updating your iPhone or Windows computer â€” you always want the latest updates, donâ€™t you?</p>

<p>Same thing goes for your website.</p>

<p><strong>I see it all theÂ timeâ€¦</strong></p>

<p>I work with many awesome business owners, marketing professionals &amp; website owners. I see a lot of insecure software â€” sadly WordPress is often one of those. Itâ€™s not the fault of WordPress, though. Is it the site owner? Maybeâ€¦the challenge here is that the person who owns the site just wants the website to work, and in todayâ€™s crazy, busy &amp; often confusing environment, a website that â€œjust worksâ€ is often good enough. Please donâ€™t let this be the case for you. Complacency is never a good thing and certainly isnâ€™t here. Iâ€™m calling on all business owners, marketing professionals â€” and everyone who owns or operates a website â€” to be proactive about keeping their websites updated (software, content, everything!). Itâ€™s great for business, you and the Internet in general.</p>

<p><em>I donâ€™t specifically fault site owners â€” most simply donâ€™t know their website is outdated and just need to be educated about updates. -Dinos</em></p>

  This is the bottomÂ line&#8230;
</h4>

<p>Donâ€™t be fooled into thinking â€œWhy would anyone want to hack my website? Itâ€™s so small and has nothing importantâ€¦â€ Ohhhhh but it does. Your website, as simple as it is, sits on a server thatâ€™s connected to other servers, other networks and other sensitive â€˜thingsâ€™. The goal of a hacker isnâ€™t to get into your website â€” they donâ€™t even care about your website â€” some just want to harm anything and everything and others want access to the server &amp; network that your website sits on to do more damage.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s not about you. â€œTheyâ€ (the hackers) are just using you. Itâ€™s about them being able to inflict more damage and annoy more people.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re not sure if your website is secure, or would like your website audited, get in touch and LWS will make your website secure.</p>
