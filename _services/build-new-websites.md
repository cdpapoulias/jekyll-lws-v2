LWS uses the following process to create your new website:

### Frequently Asked Questions

**How much will a new website cost? Are there hidden fees?**
A new website (or a redesign of an existing website) costs about $3,000 for a complete website. There are never any hidden fees. Your happiness with your website is guaranteed. Each website is different and things like e-commerce, special features etc will add to the cost. Let’s chat more!

**How long does it take?**
A basic website will take about a month to complete. Each website is different so let’s talk it through.

**Do I have to go through you to edit my website?**
Nope! Your website will be built in a way that will allow you to edit all content yourself. Things like headers, footers and adding functionality are best suited for your website company.

**Who owns the website you create?**
You do! I simply create a website for you on your behalf.

**How will my website be built?**
The vast majority of my websites are created on WordPress, but since each website has different needs, and each business has different requirements, I’ll build the website on the best software/platform to meet your needs.

**Do you provide content too?**
LWS does not supply or write content. You’ll need to provide your own content. We do edit content to ensure it’s web-friendly and make sure it’s presented in a nice way for your website visitors.

**What's the point of this? Can't I just create a Facebook page for my business and call it a day?**
You could – in fact, you should have a Facebook page too. Well-designed websites offer so much more than a simple Facebook page (or even a Wix or GoDaddy website for that matter). Custom-designed websites invite visitors and help people understand what you offer through a variety of ways from words to images and graphics. What this means is that every “thing” on your site needs to work towards a defined goal.
