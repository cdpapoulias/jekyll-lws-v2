I can generally work with any platform or software out there. I have vast experience with WordPress, Drupal, Grav CMS and many more. Lets chat more!

**Do I really need to sign up for a 6 or 12-month term?**
Yes. Being committed to keeping your website updated is one of the keys to successful marketing (and therefore making more sales).

Yes, there is a $150 minimum every month. Websites are busy places and there is always something to do.

You can request something be done with through email, phone, Google Hangout or by submitting a task request form. All work is managed through The Studio Online, where you can login, submit work to be completed, see work requests and progress, etc.

Generally speaking 24-48 hours but all my tasks are managed based on priority. All tasks are completed during normal business hours unless there is a distinct reason to work off-hours. All this is communicated through the project management system.
