How often do you redesign your website? Has it been a year? 2 years? 5 years? Do you have no idea?

While there are many reasons why you haven&#8217;t redesigned your website recently, it doesn&#8217;t necessarily matter how long it&#8217;s been (though that increases if you haven&#8217;t redesigned in over two years), here are a few solid reasons why you need to redesign your site today (and [hire LWS](/contact) to do it!):

  * You&#8217;re not getting traffic &#8211; or, you don&#8217;t even have a website analytics tool installed so you know how much traffic you&#8217;re getting
  * Your website is not secure with SSL, or, you&#8217;ve been hacked
  * Your website doesn&#8217;t look good on a tablet or a smartphone
  * Your content doesn&#8217;t reflect your current offerings as a company
  * Your website isn&#8217;t helping your company or non-profit make money

There are countless reasons to know when&#8230;but the most important thing to do is [get in touch with your website company or person](https://leadingwebstudio.com/contact/) and [review your website](https://leadingwebstudio.com/services/analyze-strategize/). Your business depends on it.
