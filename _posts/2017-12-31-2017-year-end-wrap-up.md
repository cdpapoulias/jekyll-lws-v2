**Say what!?Â **  
I had intended on posting this during the last week in 2017, but with a new baby in the house along with a toddler, and the need to disconnect for a bit, it&#8217;s just coming now. Yes, this post is backdated ðŸ˜‰

**2017**  
2017 brought the first full year of my new company name, and I welcomed many new awesome clients. I completed over 500 separate tasks, built 5 new websites, and am currently hosting 30 websites, almost all on <a href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordPress</a> but a few with a <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruby</a>-basedÂ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CMS</a> called <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jekyll</a>. I also spent considerable time dealing with a few rogue clients, which prompted me to improve my filtering of new project requests. I&#8217;m now much stricter than I used to be, and this aligns well with one of my company goals &#8211; to have great, ongoing relationships with my clients.

One thing I struggled with is the fact that I get so many emails on any given day. Some are simple questions, some require a one sentenceÂ reply, but the vast majority of them are tasks, work requestsÂ and assignments. Keeping everything straight was/is difficult. I&#8217;ve tried for many years using a combination of email and a project management system (like Basecamp, Teamwork, Proofhub, Asana &#8211; you name it, I&#8217;ve tried it) but nothing was optimal.

**2018  
** In 2018 I am implementing a new customer support system where all of the tasks, work requests and assignments will reside. One system to rule them all, if you&#8217;re familiar with the fellowship of the ring ðŸ™‚ All my requests will reside in this system, and every client will get a login to see their requests &#8211; and be able to set priority, needed completion dates etc. All my clients will have more information at their fingertips, be in more control, and I&#8217;ll be able to work more efficiently.

In 2018, I&#8217;ll be releasing at least one new subscription-basedÂ service to align the fact that the most successful websitesÂ are those continuallyÂ improved month after month.

I plan to blog A LOT more about a number of different topics, move more websites to static-flat file websites, engage with the website security community and network more.

Thanks for reading and see youÂ around the Interweb!
