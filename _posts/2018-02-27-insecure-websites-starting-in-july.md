Do you use Google&#8217;s browser, called Chrome? I bet you do and guess what? Over half of the people browsing the Internet does.

Starting in July of 2018, you&#8217;ll start seeing that any website that is not &#8220;https&#8221; secure by default will be labeled as insecure. See the image below from <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2018/02/a-secure-web-is-here-to-stay.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Googles&#8217; blog post</a>:

Many websites have already enabled https, and all websites with logins like WordPress, Drupal, Craft CMS and many others need to be secured as well.

If you happen to visit a website that isn&#8217;t secure, please do the Internet at large a favor and let the site owner know (usually through a Contact form, Support ticket or something like that). If you&#8217;re unable to find a method, please [fill out my contact form](https://leadingwebstudio.kinsta.com/contact/) and I&#8217;ll take care of it for you.

A safe, secure web is important to everyone and we all must do our part (see my [other blog post from 2017](https://leadingwebstudio.kinsta.com/blog/security/2017/03/website-security-everyones-problem/) regarding this).
