CDinos.com has been re-born as Leading Web Studio, LLC!

I’m writing to you with some exciting news about CDinos.com Consulting &#8211; a new name! CDinos.com Consulting is now Leading Web Studio, LLC.

Why change the name, might you ask? It&#8217;s an easy question to answer &#8211; but first a little history. CDinos.com Consulting was originally born back in 2000 for a project at Loyola University Maryland. I&#8217;ve always loved small businesses and websites &#8211; so I decided to start consulting and helping people with websites. To this day, I have continued to provide awesome websites for awesome people. Between 2015 and 2016, I have seen CDinos.com Consulting experience unprecedented growth and exposure, which lead me to acknowledge that my company name doesn&#8217;t do justice to what I do &#8211; and so I embarked on a journey to find a new name. Hence, Leading Web Studio, LLC.

I will continue to provide the same basic set of services, with some expanded offerings this fall and in 2017.

Thank you for reading, and please, if you have any questions or concerns, email studio@leadingwebstudio.com.
