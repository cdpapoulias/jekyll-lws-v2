I hear many people (client, potential clients) talk about SEO and how they want their website to rank on the first page of Google.

When you use search engine optimization to grow your business, it&#8217;s important to understand that SEO is not just one a one time project that you work on once.  Some of the most important parts are correct and consistent information across all your online properties, an active presence on social media, content that&#8217;s consistently published, timely and well written and lastly making sure your website is technically set up properly to facilitate SEO work.

It&#8217;s time, overdue in fact, to review a few big things about SEO:

  * **SEO Does Not Guarantee** More Traffic, or More Clients or Anything Else, for that matter  
    While SEO & online marketing in general is meant to help potential clients find your website through search engines, there is no guarantee that traffic generated through your SEO work will turn into more income. Your work here only helps, but does not guarantee anything. You could spend lots of your marketing budget with zero return, or at least, an ROI that doesn&#8217;t make it worth it. Make sure you understand this before embarking on this journey.
  * **It Takes Time** (lots of it, sometimes)  
    This is probably the most important thing to know before using SEO to create a strong online presence. Any form of marketing, digital/traditional, takes a decent amount of time before you start to see results. You wouldn’t buy a spot on a billboard and expect every person who drives by it to immediately become a customer, would you? The same principle applies to getting traffic to your website.
  * **You Can&#8217;t &#8220;Set It and Forget It&#8221;**  
    Search engine optimization is an ongoing process that requires consistent work and updates to make sure it&#8217;s helping.
